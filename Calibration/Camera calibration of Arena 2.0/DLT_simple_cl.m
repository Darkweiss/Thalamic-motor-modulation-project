function[P] = DLT_simple_cl(x,X)
%This function use direct linear method (svd) to find the coefficients P
%of the camera matrix.
%Use the fact that for any vectot x the cross product  x cprod x = null vector,
%therefore x cprod PX = null vec if P coefficients are correct. 
%The linear system is composed of 3*n equation, each is equation as
%follows:
%given x = [x1 y1 w1]' 
%    [ 0      -w1*X'   y1*X']   [P1]
%A = [ w1*X'   0      -x1*X'] * [P2] = 0  
%    [-y1*X'   x1*X'   0    ]   [P3]
%and the vector p = [P1' P2' P3']' is made so that P1' = first row of P matrix, 
%P2' = 2nd row, P3' third row. The system is (3*12) * (12*1) elements
%I use SVD so that the vector p is constrained to be |p| = 1

%generate full 3N*12 matrix
